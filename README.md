## Design

### Wireframes

for Desktop and Mobile:

![](assets/pic/Converter-Mobile.png)


### Font and Colours
I chose the RobotoSerif_Think.ttf font for the whole page to stay consistent for better user accessibility

## Features

### Existing Features
 - in the instructions, the user is asked to select the following from drop-down boxes:
   - the desired converter
   - the unit to convert from
   - the unit to convert to 

 - to enter a numeral value in the "enter value" field
 - to press the convert button

The result is being displayed in the "result area" field. An invalid entry in the "enter value" field will display a pop-up message asking the user to input a valid numeral number. The "result area" shows a valid integer number when possible, and if there are decimal placed needed, these are limited to 4 decimals.

### Future Features
 - possible future features inlcude online conversion for other units such as for the temperature, volume, area and weight.

## UX
   
### Site Goals
- the idea is to provide an easy to use, useful online conversion tool for common measure units
